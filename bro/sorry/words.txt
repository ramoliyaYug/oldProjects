Hey maru vahalu vahalu KRIPUU,

	I know that you overreacted that day, your mind was not in your control, you were frustreted, there was anger in you, you cut down the communication between us, i don't want to say but I litrelly cried at that night. 

	But remember that you are my sister and i truely mean it, my love for you will never decrease no matter what happen between us, i will always love you same for the rest of my life, it's my brotherhood promise to you. You came back that is all matters to me, I thought you will never call me again, you left me....but i am very happy that you came......  

	So my dear please don't make yourself guilty by saying sorry again and again.I forgive you already. now forget that negative memories, and let's make new beautiful ones. now smile.....I always wanted you to be smiling.... I am always here for you....let's be that old brother-sister who talks everday and spend time with each other......

	I LOVE YOU MY BABY SISTER KRIPUUUU <3 <3  :)
