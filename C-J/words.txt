HEY JIYA,

You know, ever since we got into the advance batch in 11th and the first moment I saw you I found you intresting and intriguting. (fast forwarding 1 year) We ended up in same class again in 12th, its like the universe keep throwing us together....

I want to say (as I've noticed you in school), your confidence and maturity is really impressive. IDK why but I find you n emotionally mature person which grabs my attention towards you. I wonder if you have a secret manual on how to be awesome that the rest of us didn't get.

But in all seriousness, I wanted to be honest and open with you something that has been on my mind. you are my first ever crush of my life, In the mid way of 12th I've been crushing on you but I didn't get opportunity to tell you, Still I've been debating with myself weather to tell you or not.

I value our future friendship deeply. I hope by sharing this, it doesn't creat any awkwardness and weiredness between us. No matter what, I respect your feelings. I just can't hold it to only myself anymore. I feel like you should know this too...

Regardless of how you feel, I wanted to be upfront because I think you deserve honesty. Hope you can understand how difficult to share this to you as an introvert... i really like you....Now I can't find any words to say to you....bbyeee...take care...(i am waiting for your reply)
